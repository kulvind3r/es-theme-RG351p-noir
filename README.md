# es-theme-RG351pElecNoir
An emulation station theme for RG351p devices running [351Elec](https://351elec.de/) firmware

This theme is a custom version of [es-theme-351elec-351noir](https://github.com/szalik-rg351/es-theme-351elec-351noir) maintained by [szalik-rg351](https://github.com/szalik-rg351) which itself was derived from the original [es-theme-351noir](https://github.com/MonsieurDaz/es-theme-351noir) theme by [MonsieurDaz](https://github.com/MonsieurDaz)

The repo doesn't fork the parent theme repo as this version is heavily targeted for my own personal use. 

The changes here won't be useful for wider audience and thus no contributions to upstream are planned from this version.
